# Railway-Reservation-System
<br/>
This system is basically concerned with the reservation and cancellation of railway tickets to the passengers. The need of this system arose because as is the known fact that India has the largest railway network in the whole of the world and to handle it manually is quite a tough job. The long distance road network is very poorly developed in most parts of India. Bulk of long distance traffic is carried by the Indian Railway as a result Indian railways. Therefore forms a backbone of public transport in India. The efficiency of the railway will increase result of computerization due to dramatic reduction in communication time among geographically dispersed offices. For the reservation of the ticket a person go to ticket counter of the railway reservation office and expend its valuable time in standing queue. Now to save that time we have a facility of Online Reservation now we can book cancel or search other train information just by click on computer and phones.
